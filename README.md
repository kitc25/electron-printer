# @thesusheer/electron-printer

**No recompilation required when upgrading Node.js versions, thanks to N-API!** 🎉

Native bind printers on POSIX and Windows OS from Node.js, Electron, and node-webkit.

!npm version !Prebuild Binaries and Publish

> Supports Node.js versions from 8.0.0 onwards, including the latest versions, thanks to the transition to N-API.

### **Below is the original README**

### Reason:

I was involved in a project where I needed to print from Node.js. This is the reason why I created this project and I want to share my code with others.

### Features:

* No dependencies on NAN or V8;
* Native method wrappers for Windows and POSIX (which uses CUPS 1.4/MAC OS X 10.6) APIs;
* Compatible with Node.js versions that support N-API, ensuring long-term stability and compatibility;
* Compatible with Electron versions that support N-API, reducing the need for frequent recompilation;
* `getPrinters()` to enumerate all installed printers with current jobs and statuses;
* `getPrinter(printerName)` to get a specific/default printer info with current jobs and statuses;
* `getPrinterDriverOptions(printerName)` (POSIX only) to get a specific/default printer driver options such as supported paper size and other info;
* `getSelectedPaperSize(printerName)` (POSIX only) to get a specific/default printer default paper size from its driver options;
* `getDefaultPrinterName()` returns the default printer name;
* `printDirect(options)` to send a job to a specific/default printer, now supports CUPS options passed in the form of a JS object (see `cancelJob.js` example). To print a PDF from Windows, it is possible by using node-pdfium module to convert a PDF format into EMF and then send it to the printer as EMF;
* `printFile(options)` (POSIX only) to print a file;
* `getSupportedPrintFormats()` to get all possible print formats for the `printDirect` method, which depends on the OS. `RAW` and `TEXT` are supported on all OSes;
* `getJob(printerName, jobId)` to get specific job info including job status;
* `setJob(printerName, jobId, command)` to send a command to a job (e.g., `'CANCEL'` to cancel the job);
* `getSupportedJobCommands()` to get supported job commands for `setJob()`, depending on the OS. The `'CANCEL'` command is supported on all OSes.

### Project History:

This project was originally written by Ion Lupascu using NAN and V8. It has been rewritten by @susheer to use N-API exclusively, removing dependencies on NAN and V8 to ensure better stability and compatibility with future Node.js and Electron versions.

### Node.js Version Support:

This project supports Node.js versions from 8.0.0 onwards. N-API ensures that native addons do not require recompilation when upgrading Node.js versions. For more details, refer to the [Node.js N-API documentation](https://nodejs.org/api/n-api.html)¹(https://nodejs.org/api/n-api.html).
